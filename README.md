# Battle System 2.0
A fun system for battles. 

My plan is to allow the player to choose from a simple attack or heal, and a basic enemy who will do something similar. 

I want to add stats that impact damage values, item usage, MP (Magic Points) and choosing the enemy you fight.

I also need to validate and sanitise inputs, which I will work on once the base system is finished.
